### Keygenme.py

in the python code the static part of flag is already given which is : `picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_` and later on dynamic part `xxxxxxxx`. In the code it first checks if the key we enter in program has the same length as the flag. Then it checks if the static part is same. For checking the dynamic parts 8 if statements are written:

we get the dynamic portion as _01582419


flag: picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_01582419}
