# CaaS

in `index.js` we see that theya re executing the message which we give in the url `https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/{message}` making it vulnerable to command injection.
First i go with 
`https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/ey;ls` to see whats there, i find `falg.txt` and obviously go for `https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/ey;ls;cat falg.txt`

flag: picoCTF{moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo0o}

### Forbidden Paths

it shares the directory and the flag file name, and specified absolute path is being filtered. On trying relative path, it works.
`../../../../flag.txt`

flag: picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}

### local authority

with developer mode on, entering random usrname and psswrd redirects me to `http://saturn.picoctf.net:49386/login.php` there i can see on debugger panel a mention of `secure.js` by putting the link `http://saturn.picoctf.net:49386/secure.js` it shows me a function where it compares username and password, giving me admin as username and strongPassword098765 as the password.
using these login detail i get the flag

flag:picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_b0c2c9cb}
