here the 'user_buf' is the string we enter when asked for api token, seeing that there's no format identifier in printf statement makes it prone to injection. So by putting "%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X" as input i get bunch of data in hexadecimal

translated to 

```ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Hï¿½?<ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½J<ï¿½pï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½=	ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ocip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3n5406d06dï¿½ï¿½ï¿½}ï¿½ï¿½zï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½@ï¿½}ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Ýœï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½>ï¿½ï¿½Ü¦ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Hï¿½ï¿½sï¿½@ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½	ï¿½Kï¿½<ï¿½<ï¿½ï¿½sï¿½dï¿½=ï¿½Gï¿½ï¿½<ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?8```


using this, we get the key.

*flag:- picoCTF{I_l05t_4ll_my_m0n3y_6045d60d}*

### Buffer overflow 0

as the name implies, the vulnerability lies because fgets in the source code which continues reading the character even after the 100 byte limit set.The trick is to pretty much spam with keyboard to make sure the strings are big enough to cause segmentation fault.

flag:- picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}

### Babygame01

on looking at decompiled version of the game on ghodra, the win condition is make sure aa04 isnt 0, by moving the `@` to origin of the grid would place at at the beginning of the stack with aa0, moving 4 bytes back by pressing `a` we reach aa4 where it shows `player has flag :64`
by pressing p we can directly solve the level and get the flag.

flag: picoCTF{gamer_m0d3_enabled_2682e995}

### CVE-XXXX-XXXX

just had to find the number by simple google search

flag: picoCTF{CVE-2021-34527}

---

### RPS

to get the flag, we have to win 5 times. The input is taken as rock/paper/scissor and then compared.

for comparison strstr() is ussed, this fucntion will try to match the substring in the main string, the main string being our choice and the substring being computer's choice. So by putting "rockpaperscissors" as our choice everytime, we can win.

flag: picoCTF{50M3_3X7R3M3_1UCK_C85AF58A}
